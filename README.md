# Procedural Surface Destruction System
## About
The Procedural Surface Destruction System is essentially a real-time 3D mesh generator that is meant to be used in video games.
This project was inspired by the video game "Rainbow Six: Siege" (R6S), and the implemenation of the project is based
on a GDC Talk called ["The Art of Destruction in Rainbow Six: Siege"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjkQxowsL0I&t).

This project used Raylib-CS to test algorithms in 2D first, and then once the 2D portion of the project was figured out, the algorithms was implemented in the Godot Game Engine.

## Usage
To run the 2D implementation of this project, open 2D-Implementation/2D-Implementation.sln using Visual Studio 2022 and then simply hit the Run button.

To open the Godot implementation of this project, download Godot Engine (.Net version) from [godotengine.org/](https://godotengine.org/). Then use Godot to open 
Godot Projects/game1/project.godot, and then you should be able to run a 3D demo of the project.
